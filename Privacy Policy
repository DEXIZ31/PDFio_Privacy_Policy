Last Updated: February 3, 2026

Introduction

Welcome to Photo to PDF Converter - PDFio ("PDFio," "we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

The short version: PDFio is designed with privacy in mind. Your photos and PDF documents stay on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data or files to any external servers.

Information We Do Not Collect

PDFio is an offline application. We do not collect, access, or store:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number, address)
- Photos or images from your device
- PDF documents you create
- Location data
- Device identifiers or unique IDs
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Contacts or calendar information
- Browsing history

How the App Works

PDFio operates entirely on your device:

Photos and Images: When you select photos from your library, import files, or capture images with your camera, these are processed locally on your device. Images are never uploaded to external servers.

PDF Documents: All PDF files you create are stored locally on your device within the app's private storage. You control when and how to share these files.

Camera Access: PDFio requests camera permission solely to allow you to scan documents. Camera data is processed on-device and is not transmitted anywhere.

Photo Library Access: PDFio requests photo library permission to let you select images for PDF conversion. We do not access photos beyond those you explicitly select.

Data Storage

All data created and used by PDFio is stored locally on your device:

- PDF files are saved in the app's Documents directory
- No cloud storage or remote backup is performed by the app
- Deleting the app will remove all PDFs stored within it

Third-Party Services

PDFio does not integrate with:

- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Social media platforms
- Cloud storage providers
- Any third-party data processors

When you use the iOS Share feature to export PDFs, you are interacting with other apps or services on your device. Those apps have their own privacy policies that govern how they handle shared content.

Children's Privacy

PDFio does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app is safe for users of all ages.

App Store Review Requests

PDFio may occasionally prompt you to rate the app using Apple's standard App Store review dialog. This is handled entirely by Apple's StoreKit framework. We do not collect any information about whether you leave a review or what rating you provide.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

Your Rights

Since PDFio does not collect or store your personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete from our systems. All your data remains on your device under your control.

To delete all app data, simply delete the PDFio app from your device.
